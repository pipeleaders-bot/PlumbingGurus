  <h2>Service Coordination</h2>
  <p>Plumbing Gurus acts as a dispatch and coordination service connecting customers with licensed plumbers. Some minor plumbing work may be performed by Plumbing Gurus staff where legally permitted. By using our services, you agree to this arrangement.</p>

  <h2>Estimates & Booking</h2>
  <p>All estimates provided are preliminary and based on the information you submit. Final costs may vary depending on the actual work performed. Booking a service through our website confirms your acceptance of our coordination services.</p>

  <h2>Liability</h2>
  <p>Plumbing Gurus is not responsible for damage caused by third-party contractors. We coordinate services in good faith and ensure communication, but the licensed plumbers perform the work and assume responsibility for their services.</p>

  <h2>Payments</h2>
  <p>Any fees for service coordination, travel, or estimates are separate from contractor charges. Customers are responsible for payment to the plumber for completed work, unless otherwise stated.</p>

  <h2>Website Use</h2>
  <p>You agree to use our website for lawful purposes only. You must not attempt to interfere with our systems, submit false information, or misuse any content or forms.</p>

  <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms & Conditions at any time. The latest version will always be posted on this page. Continued use of our website or services constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>
