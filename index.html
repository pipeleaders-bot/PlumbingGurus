  <h1><strong>Connecting You</strong> to Licensed Plumbing Professionals</h1>
  <p>
    Plumbing Gurus is a San Antonio–based <strong>plumbing coordination and dispatch service</strong>.
    We connect customers with independently licensed plumbing professionals for regulated plumbing work.
  </p>
  <p>
    In limited situations, we may assist with <strong>minor, non-invasive maintenance tasks</strong>
    that do not modify plumbing systems.
